	//3.3 Stack of plates, once certain threshold is reached, new stack is created - pop and push perform as if single stack
	// part 2 -> popAt(index) function on specific stack as opposed to treating it like a single stack
	
	//3.4 Queue that implements 2 stacks
	
	//3.5 Sort Stack - have a minimum values at top , can only use another stack as helper, no other data structure
